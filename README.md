- index.php — the brain. Reads the CSV, matches the incoming URL, fires the 301 redirect to fetnepal.com.
- config.php — settings file. Just holds the fallback URL (fetnepal.com homepage) for unmatched URLs.
- redirect_map.csv — your URL mapping table. The list of 158 old → new URLs. This is the only file you'll ever need to edit in future.
